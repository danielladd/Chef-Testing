# chub_sensu_scm cookbook

A cookbook for installing sensu in the way that we need it for SCM.

This cookbook uses Chef searches, so you can't fully test it with Vagrant and Chef Solo.

To test with [Test Kitchen](http://kitchen.ci/), run `kitchen test all`.  
But think about doing this because I haven't written any tests
