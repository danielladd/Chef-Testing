# Database connection/statement pool configuration
# Basic Pool Configuration
# Minimum number of Connections a pool will maintain at any given time. (Default: 3)
tattler.pool.minPoolSize=3
# Maximum number of Connections a pool will maintain at any given time. (Default: 15)
tattler.pool.maxPoolSize=15
# Number of Connections a pool will try to acquire upon startup. Should be between minPoolSize and maxPoolSize. (Default: 3)
tattler.pool.initialPoolSize=3
# Determines how many connections at a time c3p0 will try to acquire when the pool is exhausted. (Default: 3)
tattler.pool.acquireIncrement=3
# Connection Age
# Seconds a Connection can remain pooled but unused before being discarded. Zero means idle connections never expire.  (Default: 0; 14400 is 4 hours)
tattler.pool.maxIdleTime=14400
# Connection Testing
# Defines the query that will be executed for all connection tests (Default: null)
tattler.pool.preferredTestQuery=SELECT 1
# If this is a number greater than 0, c3p0 will test all idle, pooled but unchecked-out connections, every this number of seconds. (Default: 0)
tattler.pool.idleConnectionTestPeriod=0
# If true, an operation will be performed asynchronously at every connection checkin to verify that the connection is valid.  Use in combination with idleConnectionTestPeriod for quite reliable, always asynchronous Connection testing. (Default: false)
tattler.pool.testConnectionOnCheckin=false
# Use only if necessary. Expensive. If true, an operation will be performed at every connection checkout to verify that the connection is valid. Better choice: verify connections periodically using idleConnectionTestPeriod. (Default: false)
tattler.pool.testConnectionOnCheckout=true
# Statement Pooling
# The number of PreparedStatements c3p0 will cache for a single pooled Connection. (Default: 0)
tattler.pool.maxStatementsPerConnection=15
# Recovery From Database Outages
# Defines how many times c3p0 will try to acquire a new Connection from the database before giving up. If this value is less than or equal to zero, c3p0 will keep trying to fetch a Connection indefinitely. (Default: 30)
tattler.pool.acquireRetryAttempts=5
# Milliseconds, time c3p0 will wait between acquire attempts. (Default: 1000)
tattler.pool.acquireRetryDelay=1000
# Other Configuration
# c3p0 is very asynchronous. Slow JDBC operations are generally performed by helper threads that don't hold contended locks. Spreading these operations over multiple threads can significantly improve performance by allowing multiple operations to be performed simultaneously. (Default: 3)
tattler.pool.numHelperThreads=3
